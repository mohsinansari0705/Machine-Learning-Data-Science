    "But when it comes to classification, you'll likely want to use a few more evaluation metrics, including:\n",
    "* [**Confusion matrix**](https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/) - Compares the predicted values with the true values in a tabular way, if 100% correct, all values in the matrix will be top left to bottom right (diagnol line).\n",
    "* [**Cross-validation**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) - Splits your dataset into multiple parts and train and tests your model on each part and evaluates performance as an average. \n",
    "* [**Precision**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of samples. Higher precision leads to less false positives.\n",
    "* [**Recall**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of true positives and false positives. Higher recall leads to less false negatives.\n",
    "* [**F1 score**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) - Combines precision and recall into one metric. 1 is best, 0 is worst.\n",
    "* [**Classification report**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) - Sklearn has a built-in function called `classification_report()` which returns some of the main classification metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score.\n",
    "* [**ROC Curve**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_score.html) - [Receiver Operating Characterisitc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) is a plot of true positive rate versus false positive rate.\n",
    "* [**Area Under Curve (AUC)**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html) - The area underneath the ROC curve. A perfect model achieves a score of 1.0.\n",

    "* **Accuracy** - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0.\n",
    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn’t class imbalance into effort, so if you do have class imbalances, pay attention to this metric.\n",
    "* **Weighted avg** - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
