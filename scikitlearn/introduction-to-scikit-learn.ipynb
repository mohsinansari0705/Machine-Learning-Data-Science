    "## Why Scikit-Learn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the fields of data science and machine learning are vast, the main goal is finding patterns within data and then using those patterns to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are certain categories which a majority of problems fall into.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict whether an email is spam and or not spam, you're working on a [classification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification#Binary_and_multiclass_classification) (whether something is one thing or another).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to create a machine learning model to predict the price of houses given their characteristics, you're working on a [regression problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (predicting a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're trying to get a machine learning algorithm to group together similar samples (that you don't necessarily know which should go together), you're working on a [clustering problem](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you know what kind of problem you're working on, there are also similar steps you'll take for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps like splitting the data into different sets, one for your machine learning algorithms to learn on (the training set) and another to test them on (the testing set).\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a machine learning model and then evaluating whether or not your model has learned anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn offers Python implementations for doing all of these kinds of tasks (from preparing data to modelling data). Saving you from having to build them from scratch."

Well, the answer is that `Doors` could be either numerical or categorical. However, I've decided to go with categorical, since where I'm from, number of doors is often a different *category* of car. For example, you can shop for 4-door cars or shop for 5-door cars (which always confused me since where's the 5th door?).

    "We could do this for the `Make` and `Colour` features.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the `Doors` feature, we could use `\"missing\"` or we could fill it with the most common option of `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the `Odometer (KM)` feature, we can use the mean value of all the other values in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, for those samples which are missing a `Price` value, we can remove them (since `Price` is the target value, removing probably causes less harm than imputing, however, you could design an experiment to test this).\n",

    "> **Note:** The practice of filling missing data with given or calculated values is called [**imputation**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html). And it's important to remember there's no perfect way to fill missing data (unless it's with data that should've actually been there in the first place). The methods we're using are only one of many. The techniques you use will depend heavily on your dataset. A good place to look would be searching for \"data imputation techniques\".\n",

[`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(estimator, X, y)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html#sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator) - this takes a fitted estimator (like our `clf` model), features (`X`) and labels (`y`), it then uses the trained estimator to make predictions on `X` and compares the predictions to `y` by displaying a confusion matrix.\n",

[`sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_true, y_pred)`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.html#sklearn.metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions) - this takes truth labels and predicted labels and compares them by displaying a confusion matrix."

    "* **Macro avg** - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn't take class imbalance into effect. So if you do have class imbalances (more examples of one class than another), you should pay attention to this.\n",

Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. it will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples)."

For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. Higher is better.\n",
